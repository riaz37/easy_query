## Soonami Venturethon Achievements

During the soonami Venturethon (Edition 8, Sept 15-28, 2025), our team accelerated easy-query.ai from a frontend-only prototype to a full-stack MVP. Key achievements:

- **Models Switching**: Integrated RLHF with agentic RAG architecture using xAI API for enhanced NLP-to-SQL accuracy and personalized query refinement. We used models hosted on groq.com. Currently two models are use llama and gemini.
- **Codebase Clean-up**: Refactored the entire codebase for modularity, improved error handling, and ensured compliance with security best practices (no data storage, JWT/RBAC).
- **Dashboard Polish**: Enhanced UI/UX with Tailwind CSS for responsive design, adding real-time metrics widgets, quick actions, and admin views.
- **Query Generator**: Developed core NLP query engine with SQL preview, execution, and 90% success rate via AI assistance.

These advancements align with Venturethon tracks (New Ventures & EIR), demonstrating innovation in AI for database orchestration. We completed daily check-ins, team building, and prepared for Demo Day on Oct 3.
